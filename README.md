# Inspiration

Ever since we entered College, our stress levels have never been higher. We learned the hard way that time management was key to having a stable life during college.

# What it does

Our application gives users the option for them to select between three popular time management techniques: Pomodoro, Focus Block, and 52-17 Rule, and gives them an interactive timer that they can control.

# How we built it

We used the ReactJS and Bootstrap frameworks to build and style our web application.

# Challenges we ran into

The biggest challenge we encountered was definitely learning to work with react hooks. This concept was very abstract, which made it extra hard and we had to spend a lot of hours trying different functions to make our hooks work. Another challenge was using navigation on the website.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud to have successfully built our first web application using popular frameworks like React and Bootstrap, as we've only ever used basic HTML, CSS and Javascript in the past.

# What we learned

We learned how to use React and Bootstrap. We also improved our Javascript knowledge.

# What's next for Study Time

We were thinking of expanding the study-oriented aspects of the project by implementing many tools that students would be sure to find useful. (Todo lists, Calendars, Course trackers for assignments and deadlines, Studying tools like etc.) Eventually, we would love for Study Time to be a student's central hub for all of his study-related applications.
